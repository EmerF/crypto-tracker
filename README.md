# Crypto Tracker Portfolio Project

## Overview
This is a **Crypto Tracker** application built as part of my portfolio project. The goal of this project is to track cryptocurrency prices, market caps, and other relevant data in real-time. This application integrates with external APIs, such as CoinGecko, to provide accurate and up-to-date information about various cryptocurrencies. The app is designed to help users track the market and make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Integrates with the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data (prices, market cap, etc.).
- **Responsive User Interface**: Built with a user-friendly interface to display market trends and historical data.
- **Data Storage**: Allows storing and managing cryptocurrency data within the application.
- **Search Functionality**: Enables users to search for specific cryptocurrencies by symbol.
- **Price and Market Cap Tracking**: Displays price, market cap, and other relevant metrics for tracked cryptocurrencies.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building the RESTful API.
- **WebClient**: For making asynchronous HTTP requests to external APIs (like CoinGecko).
- **Java**: Core programming language for building the application.
- **React (optional)**: Frontend (if applicable).
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing data (if applicable).
- **JUnit & Mockito**: For unit testing and mocking external services.
- **Docker**: Containerization for development and deployment.
